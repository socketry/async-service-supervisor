# Releases

## v0.9.1

  - Close `Call` queue if asynchronous call fails during dispatch - further messages will fail with `ClosedQueueError`.

## v0.9.0

  - Better handling of write failures in `Connection::Call.dispatch`, ensuring we don't leak calls.
  - Robust monitor loop handling - restart on failure, and align loop iterations.
  - Disable memory sampler by default and use text output format.
      - Introduce support for redirecting dump output to logs.

## v0.8.0

  - Add `Async::Service::Supervisor::ProcessMonitor` for logging CPU and memory metrics periodically.
  - Fix documentation to use correct `maximum_size_limit:` parameter name for `MemoryMonitor` (was incorrectly documented as `limit:`).

## v0.7.0

  - If a memory leak is detected, sample memory usage for 60 seconds before exiting.

## v0.6.4

  - Make client task (in supervised worker) transient, so that it doesn't keep the reactor alive unnecessarily. It also won't be stopped by default when SIGINT is received, so that the worker will remain connected to the supervisor until the worker is completely terminated.

## v0.6.3

  - Add agent context documentation.

## v0.6.2

  - Fix timed out RPCs and subsequent responses which should be ignored.

## v0.6.0

  - Add `async:container:supervisor:reload` command to restart the container (blue/green deployment).

## v0.1.0

  - Initial implementation.
