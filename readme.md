Provides a supervisor service for

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/async-service-supervisor/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/async-service-supervisor/actions?workflow=Test)

## Features

  - Supports multi-process, multi-thread and hybrid containers.
  - Automatic scalability based on physical hardware.
  - Direct integration with [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html) using `$NOTIFY_SOCKET`.
  - Internal process readiness protocol for handling state changes.
  - Automatic restart of failed processes.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/async-service-supervisor/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/async-service-supervisor/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to get started with `async-service-supervisor` to supervise and monitor worker processes in your Ruby applications.

  - [Memory Monitor](https://socketry.github.io/async-service-supervisor/guides/memory-monitor/index) - This guide explains how to use the <code class="language-ruby">Async::Service::Supervisor::MemoryMonitor</code> to detect and restart workers that exceed memory limits or develop memory leaks.

  - [Process Monitor](https://socketry.github.io/async-service-supervisor/guides/process-monitor/index) - This guide explains how to use the <code class="language-ruby">Async::Service::Supervisor::ProcessMonitor</code> to log CPU and memory metrics for your worker processes.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/async-service-supervisor/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.9.1

  - Close `Call` queue if asynchronous call fails during dispatch - further messages will fail with `ClosedQueueError`.

### v0.9.0

  - Better handling of write failures in `Connection::Call.dispatch`, ensuring we don't leak calls.
  - Robust monitor loop handling - restart on failure, and align loop iterations.
  - Disable memory sampler by default and use text output format.
      - Introduce support for redirecting dump output to logs.

### v0.8.0

  - Add `Async::Service::Supervisor::ProcessMonitor` for logging CPU and memory metrics periodically.
  - Fix documentation to use correct `maximum_size_limit:` parameter name for `MemoryMonitor` (was incorrectly documented as `limit:`).

### v0.7.0

  - If a memory leak is detected, sample memory usage for 60 seconds before exiting.

### v0.6.4

  - Make client task (in supervised worker) transient, so that it doesn't keep the reactor alive unnecessarily. It also won't be stopped by default when SIGINT is received, so that the worker will remain connected to the supervisor until the worker is completely terminated.

### v0.6.3

  - Add agent context documentation.

### v0.6.2

  - Fix timed out RPCs and subsequent responses which should be ignored.

### v0.6.0

  - Add `async:container:supervisor:reload` command to restart the container (blue/green deployment).

### v0.1.0

  - Initial implementation.
